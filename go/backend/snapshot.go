// Snapshots capture a state of a single or a set of data structures at a
// moment in time for future reference.
//
// Snapshots are volatile, thus they do not survive the current process.
// Snapshots are created by calling a corresponding factory function, typically
// `CreateSnapshot` on the data structure to be snapshotted, and released by
// calling the snapshot's `Release` method.
//
// Logically, each snapshot describes a range of `Parts`, where each part
// describes a chunk of data of the data structure's forzen state. Parts can
// be retrieved individually, to facilitate streaming of snapshots, potentially
// even from multiple sources.
//
// Each part has a Proof associated, capable of certifying its content. Those
// proofs are, like Parts, data structure dependent.
//
// Furthermore, snapshots provide access to Proofs of Parts without retrieving
// the full Part and its associated data, for faster cross-validation.
//
// Finally, a snapshot combines the proofs of all its parts into a single root
// proof, to cross-validate snapshots without the need of exchanging all the
// proofs of its parts. The algorithm used for aggregating those proofs is
// data structure dependent.
