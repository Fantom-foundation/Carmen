// Store is a mutable key/value store. It provides mutation/lookup support, as well as
// global state hashing support to obtain a quick hash for the entire content.

// The type I is the type used for the ordinal numbers,
// the type V for the store values - needs to be serializable.

	// Set creates a new mapping from the index to the value
	Set(id I, value V) error

	// Get a value associated with the index (or a default value if not defined)
	Get(id I) (V, error)

	// GetStateHash computes and returns a cryptographical hash of the stored data
	GetStateHash() (common.Hash, error)

	// provides the size of the store in memory in bytes
	common.MemoryFootprintProvider

	// Also, stores need to be flush and closable.
