// Cache implements a memory overlay for the key-value pair.
// The keys can be set and obtained from the cache. The keys
// accumulate in the cache until the cache is full, i.e. it reaches its capacity.
// When this happens, a new key causes eviction of another key.

	// Get returns a value from the cache or false. If the value exists, its number of use is updated
	Get(key K) (V, bool)
	// Set associates a key to the cache.
	// If the key is already present, the value is updated and the key marked as
	// used. If the value is not present, a new entry is added to this
	// cache. This causes another entry to be removed if the cache size is exceeded.

	// If the key does not exist, the input value is stored under this key.
	// When the key is stored in this cache, another key and value may be evicted.
	// This method returns true if the key was present in the cache. It also returns if another key was evicted due
	// to inserting this key.

	// or nested structs.
