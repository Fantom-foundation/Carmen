// Proof is an interface for witness proofs. A witness proof is a data structure that
// contains a witness for a subset of the state. The witness proof can be used to
// extract information, such as account balances, nonces, code hashes,
// and storage slots. The witness proof is self-contained and does not require access to
// the full state to extract information.
